### Project Objectives

Students will create their own custom interactive application that includes the following functionality:

- must use birthday in form, 12 options
- Users can enter any valid entry. The application will computer the correct response for the input.
- Users can re-enter any valid entry. The application will re-compute the correct response.
- The user interface will display all of the custom outputs in an interactive format that allows user selection. When the user selects an option, the corresponding data and effects will be activated and displayed.
- Each option must be represented in a unique visual way and use sound effects
- The application must have a help screen that clearly defines how the application works.
    - describe what to do “type a valid birthday in the field or click on a card”
